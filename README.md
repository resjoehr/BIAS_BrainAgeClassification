# BIAS_BrainAgeClassification
This Poster is related to the following Repository: https://github.com/matlab-deep-learning/Brain-MRI-Age-Classification-using-Deep-Learning

The poster shows how to work with an MRI brain image dataset and how to use transfer learning to modify and retrain ResNet-18, a pretrained convolutional neural network, to perform image classification on that dataset. Additionally, the workflow applies occlusion sensitivity for the verification of the trained networks.
